But as the most basic criteria of food security, getting enough calories is an important measure.

      "descriptionProcessing": "- For all countries, the data after 1960 is taken from FAOSTAT Food Balances datasets ([old](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBSH) and [new](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS) methodologies combined).\n- For the UK: We load Appendix Table from [Harris et al. (2015)](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0363-326820150000031003/full/html). From that table, we select values from [Broadberry et al. (2015)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/british-economic-growth-12701870/A270234C137117C8E0F1D1E7E6F0DA56) and the corrected values from [Floud et al (2011)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/changing-body/DE3BB0E3577205AC26823CF2120D8B7E) (taking the average value of Estimates (A) and (B)).\n- For the US: For years 1800-1900, we use Table 6.6 of [Floud et al. (2011)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/changing-body/DE3BB0E3577205AC26823CF2120D8B7E). For years 1900-1960, we use [the archived table of food supply from USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/50472/nutrients.xls?v=6096.1).\n- For Iceland: We use Table 5 of [Jonsson (1994)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03585522.1998.10414677).\n- For Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway: We use Table 1 from [Grigg (1995)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305748885700187), which is a compilation of many sources.\n- For France: We use Table 1 from Grigg (1995).\n  - We include the two additional data points (1705 and 1785) from [Fogel (2004)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/escape-from-hunger-and-premature-death-17002100/384C6032DE4E73C90EF6C9D1E55009CA).\n- For Belgium and Netherlands: We use Table 5.5 of Floud et al. (2011).\n- For Uganda, Cambodia, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru for 1936 and 1947: We use Table 11 of [FAO (2000)](https://www.fao.org/4/x4400e/x4400e.pdf) (The State of Food and Agriculture).\n- For many countries (including some of the above) for 1947 and 1948: We use values from Table 15 from [FAO (1949)](https://www.fao.org/4/ap637e/ap637e.pdf).\n- Note that prior to 1961, data for the UK may correspond to England, or England and Wales; and Tanzania refers to Tanganyika.",
